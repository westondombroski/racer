## Technologies Used

This game was built using html, css and javascript/jquery-3.

## Current Features

Car 1 races using the enter key and Car 2 with the spacebar. When it's all said and done, a banner of whoever crosses the finishline first will pop up in the middle of the screen (these banners are currently places behind the scenes with a class of "hidden"). As I went with .animate() to move the cars, I'm having trouble finding a method that will be able to tell when the car crosses the finishline.

## Planned Features

I plan on introducing some sound effects into the mix at some point and hopefully will get the winner banners working in the very near future.
